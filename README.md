# This Is Jeopardy! Challenge Project

You will work to write several functions that investigate a dataset of *Jeopardy!* questions and answers. Filter the dataset for topics that youâ€™re interested in, compute the average difficulty of those questions, and train to become the next *Jeopardy!* champion!

For the "extra credit" part, I just couldn't wrap my head around how to come up with the typical Categories for *Final Jeopardy!* Maybe at a later point it will be obvious to me, but not today!
